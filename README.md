# Enhancing Rhyming Abilities of Neural Models for Lyrics Generation
This is my MSc Project with Huawei. The project name is "Enhancing Rhyming Abilities of Neural Models for Lyrics Generation".

## Download the data
The data used in this project is from [Chinese Lyric Corpus](https://github.com/gaussic/Chinese-Lyric-Corpus).
We need to download the zip file and unzip it as a large *Chinese_Lyrics* folder with 494 small folders indicated by the artists'names.
Then we can use the [data_prepare.ipynb](https://github.com/YubingWang/UCL-Huawei-MSc-Project/blob/main/data_prepare.ipynb) to preprocess the data into a large text file containing all the lyrics from each song line by line and a small text file containing all the singers'names.

## Prepare the data
